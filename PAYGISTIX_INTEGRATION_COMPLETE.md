# Paygistix Payment Integration Complete

## Date: January 11, 2025

### Overview
Successfully integrated Paygistix payment gateway into the WaveMAX affiliate program system with context-based filtering and proper handling for both customer registration and order payments.

### Key Components Implemented:

#### 1. Reusable Payment Form Component
- **File**: `/public/assets/js/paygistix-payment-form.js`
- **Features**:
  - Context-based line item filtering (REGISTRATION vs ORDER)
  - Dynamic pricing from system configuration
  - Affiliate-specific pricing for orders
  - Show/hide line items instead of dynamic creation

#### 2. Payment Configuration Endpoint
- **File**: `/server/routes/paymentConfigRoute.js`
- **Endpoint**: `/api/v1/payments/config`
- **Returns**: Paygistix form configuration from environment variables

#### 3. Payment Callback Handler
- **File**: `/public/payment-callback-handler.html`
- **Purpose**: Processes payment callbacks for both registration and order payments
- **Flow**:
  1. Receives callback from Paygistix
  2. Checks payment status
  3. For registration: Completes customer account creation
  4. For orders: Updates order payment status

#### 4. Customer Registration Integration
- **File**: `/public/customer-register-embed.html`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced manual payment fields with Paygistix component
  - Added PAYCONTEXT hidden element set to "REGISTRATION"
  - Only shows BF (Bag Fee) line item
  - Stores pending registration in sessionStorage
  - Submits to Paygistix for payment processing

### Configuration:

#### Environment Variables Required:
```bash
PAYGISTIX_MERCHANT_ID=wmaxaustWEB

PAYGISTIX_FORM_HASH=your_actual_hash_here
PAYGISTIX_FORM_ACTION_URL=https://safepay.paymentlogistics.net/transaction.asp
```

#### System Configuration:
- **laundry_bag_fee**: $10.00 (used for registration bag fee)
- **wdf_base_rate_per_pound**: $1.25 (used for order processing)

### Line Item Codes:
- **BF**: Bag Fee ($10.00 per bag)

- **MC45**: $45 minimum delivery fee

### Context-Based Filtering:

#### Registration Context:
- Only BF (Bag Fee) line item is visible
- Quantity based on customer's bag selection
- Total = Number of bags Ã— $10.00

#### Order Context:
- BF is hidden
- WDF is visible
- Delivery fees matching affiliate settings are visible
- Shows appropriate per-bag fee and minimum fee

### Testing:

1. **Test Registration Payment**:
   - Navigate to `/test-paygistix-registration.html`
   - Verify only BF line item shows
   - Test bag quantity updates

2. **Test Live Registration**:

   - Select number of bags
   - Complete registration
   - Verify payment processes correctly

3. **Verify Return URLs**:

### Security Notes:

- All payment processing handled by Paygistix
- Customer data temporarily stored in sessionStorage
- Payment confirmation required before account creation
- Hash value must be kept secure in environment variables

### Future Enhancements:
