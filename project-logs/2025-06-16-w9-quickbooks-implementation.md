## Technical Decisions

### Storage Architecture
- **Location**: `/secure/w9-documents/` (outside web root)
- **Encryption**: AES-256 at rest
- **Access**: API-only with authentication

### Security Measures
- Never store full SSN/EIN (only last 4 digits)
- All document access logged
- Role-based permissions (admin only for W-9 review)
- Automatic expiry after 7 years

### QuickBooks Export Format
- CSV format for vendor import
- Masked tax IDs in exports
- Standardized field mapping
- Period-based payment summaries

// Add to affiliateSchema in server/models/Affiliate.js
w9Information: {
  status: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['not_submitted', 'pending_review', 'verified', 'rejected', 'expired'],
    default: 'not_submitted'
  },
  submittedAt: Date,
  verifiedAt: Date,

  quickbooksData: {
    displayName: String,
    vendorType: String,
    terms: String,
    defaultExpenseAccount: String
  }
}
```

### New Models Location
- `/server/models/W9Document.js`
- `/server/models/PaymentExport.js`

### New Utilities Location
- `/server/utils/w9Storage.js`

### API Endpoints Created ✅
```
POST   /api/v1/w9/upload                     - Affiliate uploads W-9 document
GET    /api/v1/w9/status                     - Get affiliate's W-9 status
GET    /api/v1/w9/download                   - Download affiliate's own W-9
GET    /api/v1/w9/admin/pending              - List pending W-9 documents (admin)
POST   /api/v1/w9/admin/:affiliateId/verify  - Verify W-9 document (admin)
POST   /api/v1/w9/admin/:affiliateId/reject  - Reject W-9 document (admin)
GET    /api/v1/w9/admin/:affiliateId/download - Download any W-9 (admin)

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] W-9 upload accepts only PDFs

- [ ] Affiliates see correct status
- [ ] Payment holds work correctly
- [ ] Admin can download and verify

## Known Issues & Risks
1. **File Size**: Need to limit W-9 uploads to reasonable size (5MB)
2. **PDF Validation**: Must ensure uploaded files are valid PDFs
3. **Email Attachments**: Some providers may block PDF attachments
4. **QuickBooks Format**: May need adjustment based on QB version

## Recovery Instructions
If interrupted, check this log for:
1. Current phase and completed tasks
2. Next immediate steps
3. Code snippets for quick implementation
4. Test scenarios to validate work
