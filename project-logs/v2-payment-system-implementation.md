# V2 Payment System Implementation Log

**Project Start Date:** 2025-01-27
**Status:** IN PROGRESS
**Current Phase:** Phase 1 - Configuration & Feature Toggle

## Project Overview
Replacing credit card payments (Paygistix) with Venmo, PayPal, and CashApp payment links. Implementing automated payment verification via email scanning on payments@wavemax.promo.

## Key Requirements
- No payment during registration (v2 customers get 1-2 free bags)
- Generate payment links after laundry is weighed
- Automated payment verification via Mailcow email scanning
- Hold pickup notifications until payment verified
- Feature toggle to switch between v1 and v2 systems

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Configuration & Feature Toggle ‚úÖ
- [x] Add SystemConfig entries for v2 payment system
- [x] Update database schemas (Customer, Order models)
- [x] Create payment link generation service
- [ ] Implement feature toggle logic

### Phase 2: Email Integration ‚úÖ
- [x] Mailcow API integration service
- [x] Email parser for Venmo notifications
- [x] Email parser for PayPal notifications  
- [x] Email parser for CashApp notifications
- [x] Payment verification cron job

### Phase 3: V2 Registration & Scheduling üìù
- [ ] Create customer-register-v2-embed.html
- [ ] Create schedule-pickup-v2-embed.html
- [ ] Update authController for v2 registration
- [ ] Update orderController for v2 scheduling

### Phase 4: Payment Processing Flow üí∞
- [ ] Payment request generation after weighing
- [ ] QR code generation for payment methods
- [ ] Payment verification loop after WDF
- [ ] Notification hold/release logic

### Phase 5: Admin & Testing üéØ
- [ ] Admin dashboard payment monitoring
- [ ] Manual payment override interface
- [ ] End-to-end testing
- [ ] Production deployment

## Progress Log

### 2025-01-27 - Session Start
**Time:** [Session Start]
**Tasks Completed:**
1. ‚úÖ Created project documentation and implementation plan
2. ‚úÖ Implemented SystemConfig updates (10 new configs added)
3. ‚úÖ Updated database schemas:
   - Customer model: Added registrationVersion and initialBagsRequested
   - Order model: Added 12 v2 payment fields (prefixed with v2)
4. ‚úÖ Created payment link generation service
5. ‚úÖ Installed qrcode package
6. ‚úÖ Created and tested payment link generation

**Technical Accomplishments:**
- SystemConfig entries added via script (scripts/add-v2-payment-config.js)
- Payment link formats validated for Venmo, PayPal, and CashApp
- QR code generation working for all payment methods
- HTML generation for email templates implemented

**Next Steps:**
- Implement feature toggle logic in controllers
- Start Phase 2: Email Integration with Mailcow

### 2025-01-27 - Phase 2 Progress
**Tasks Completed:**
1. ‚úÖ Added translations for payment HTML (Spanish, Portuguese, German)
2. ‚úÖ Created comprehensive tests for paymentLinkService
3. ‚úÖ Created tests for V2 model changes
4. ‚úÖ Implemented Mailcow API service with fallback methods
5. ‚úÖ Created payment email scanner with provider-specific parsing
6. ‚úÖ Implemented automatic payment verification logic

**Phase 2 Components:**
- `mailcowService.js` - Handles Mailcow API communication
- `paymentEmailScanner.js` - Parses emails and verifies payments
- Support for Venmo, PayPal, and CashApp email formats
- Automatic order status updates upon payment verification

**Next Steps:**
- Create payment verification cron job
- Implement feature toggle in controllers
- Create V2 registration and scheduling forms

### 2025-01-27 - Phase 3 Progress
**Tasks Completed:**
1. ‚úÖ Created payment verification cron job with configurable intervals
2. ‚úÖ Integrated cron job into server startup
3. ‚úÖ Implemented feature toggle logic in customer controller
4. ‚úÖ Updated order controller for V2 payment flow
5. ‚úÖ Added automatic payment link generation after weighing

**Controller Updates:**
- Customer controller: Detects V2 mode and skips payment for registration
- Order controller: Generates payment links when order is weighed
- V2 customers get free initial bags (configurable)
- Payment status tracking throughout order lifecycle

**Next Steps:**
- Create V2 registration and scheduling HTML forms
- Implement payment request email templates
- Test end-to-end flow

## Technical Decisions

### Payment Link Formats
```javascript
// Venmo
venmo://paycharge?txn=pay&recipients=${handle}&amount=${amount}&note=WaveMAX%20Order%20%23${orderId}

// PayPal
https://paypal.me/${handle}/${amount}USD?notes=WaveMAX%20Order%20%23${orderId}

// CashApp
https://cash.app/${handle}/${amount}?note=WaveMAX%20Order%20%23${orderId}
```

### Email Scanning Strategy
- Poll payments@wavemax.promo every 5 minutes
- Parse emails for order ID in memo/note field
- Match amount with order total
- Auto-verify and trigger notifications

### Database Changes
- Order.paymentStatus: ['pending', 'awaiting', 'verified', 'failed']
- Order.paymentLinks: {venmo, paypal, cashapp}
- Order.paymentQRCodes: {venmo, paypal, cashapp}
- Customer.registrationVersion: 'v1' | 'v2'
- Customer.initialBagsRequested: Number
