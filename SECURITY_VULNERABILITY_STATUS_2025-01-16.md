# Security Vulnerability Status Report
**Date:** 2025-01-16  
**Reviewer:** Security Analysis  

## Executive Summary

After reviewing the security audit report from 2025-07-14 and investigating the current codebase, **ALL FOUR CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES REMAIN UNREMEDIATED**. These vulnerabilities pose immediate and severe security risks to the application and require urgent attention.

## Critical Vulnerabilities Status

### 1. Store IP Authentication Bypass - ❌ NOT REMEDIATED
**Location:** `/server/middleware/auth.js` lines 55-92  
**Current Status:** The vulnerability is still present. Expired JWT tokens from whitelisted store IPs are automatically renewed without requiring re-authentication.  
**Evidence:** Code review shows the automatic token renewal logic is still active (lines 60-87).  
**Risk:** Compromised store locations can maintain indefinite access to the system.

### 2. NoSQL Injection via Regex - ❌ NOT REMEDIATED
**Locations:** 
- `/server/controllers/affiliateController.js` (lines 422-426, 579-580)
- `/server/controllers/orderController.js` (lines 981-983)  
- `/server/controllers/administratorController.js` (lines 1699-1703)

**Current Status:** User input is still being directly used in MongoDB `$regex` queries without escaping.  
**Evidence:** While a proper `escapeRegex` function exists in `/server/utils/securityUtils.js`, it is not being imported or used by the vulnerable controllers.  
**Risk:** ReDoS attacks, query manipulation, potential data exposure.

### 3. OAuth Access Token Storage in Plain Text - ❌ NOT REMEDIATED
**Locations:**
- `/server/config/passport-config.js` lines 41-42 (Google Customer)
- `/server/config/passport-config.js` lines 122-123 (Google Affiliate)  
- `/server/config/passport-config.js` lines 371-372 (Facebook)

**Current Status:** OAuth access tokens and refresh tokens are still stored unencrypted in the database.  
**Evidence:** No encryption functions are being called before storing tokens.  
**Risk:** Database breach would expose all user OAuth tokens.

### 4. Open Redirect Vulnerability - ❌ NOT REMEDIATED
**Location:** `/server.js` line 120  
**Current Status:** HTTPS redirect still uses the user-controlled `host` header without validation.  
**Evidence:** The redirect code directly uses `req.header('host')` without any whitelist validation.  
**Risk:** Phishing attacks through trusted domain redirects.

## Recommendations

These critical vulnerabilities must be addressed immediately as they represent severe security risks:

1. **Immediate Actions Required:**
   - Remove or redesign the store IP authentication bypass mechanism
   - Import and use the `escapeRegex` function in all controllers using regex queries
   - Implement OAuth token encryption before storage
   - Add host header validation for HTTPS redirects

2. **Available Resources:**
   - The `escapeRegex` function already exists in `/server/utils/securityUtils.js`
   - Encryption utilities may already exist in the codebase for token encryption

3. **Testing After Fixes:**
   - Ensure all authentication flows work correctly after removing the bypass
   - Test search functionality after implementing regex escaping
   - Verify OAuth login flows work with encrypted tokens
   - Test HTTPS redirects with various host headers

## Conclusion

The application remains vulnerable to all four critical security issues identified in the July 2025 audit. These vulnerabilities could lead to:
- Unauthorized persistent access
- Service disruption through ReDoS attacks
- Mass token theft from database breaches
- Phishing attacks via open redirects

**Immediate remediation is strongly recommended.**
