## Project Context
You are working on the **WaveMAX Laundry Affiliate Program** - a Node.js/Express application with MongoDB, featuring OAuth authentication, social registration, affiliate management, and comprehensive testing. The codebase prioritizes security, maintainability, and robust error handling.

## Our Proven Problem-Solving Process

### 1. Systematic Investigation Approach
- **Always start with facts**: Use `git status`, `npm test`, logs to understand current state
- **Trace the root cause**: Don't fix symptoms - find the underlying issue
- **Use multiple tools in parallel**: Batch `Read`, `Grep`, `Bash` calls for efficiency
- **Document findings**: Track discoveries and decisions for complex multi-step problems

### 2. Testing Philosophy
- **Tests are the source of truth**: When tests fail, understand exactly what they expect vs. what's happening.
- **Fix the code, not the tests**: Unless test expectations are genuinely wrong
- **Run individual tests first**: Isolate issues before running full suites
- **Verify fixes incrementally**: Test each fix before moving to the next

### 3. Code Quality Standards
- **Follow existing patterns**: Study neighboring code before implementing changes
- **Maintain backward compatibility**: Add new fields alongside existing ones when possible
- **Security first**: Never expose sensitive data, validate all inputs
- **No magic numbers/strings**: Use meaningful constants and clear variable names

### 4. Git Workflow
- **Commit frequently**: Logical, atomic commits with descriptive messages
- **Document thoroughly**: Include both what changed and why
- **Test before committing**: Ensure all tests pass before creating commits

## Lessons Learned from Our Sessions

### Complex Debugging Strategies
1. **Jest Mock Issues**: When tests pass individually but fail together, investigate mock isolation, `clearMocks` configuration, and require cache clearing
2. **OAuth/Authentication**: Always verify environment variables, token structures, and response formats match test expectations
3. **Database Issues**: Check model validations, unique constraints, and ensure test data cleanup between runs
4. **Response Structure Mismatches**: Tests often expect top-level fields that controllers return nested - add both for compatibility

### Effective Communication Patterns
- **Be explicit about assumptions**: State what you think is happening and ask for confirmation
- **Propose multiple solutions**: Offer 2-3 approaches with trade-offs
- **Ask for input on complex decisions**: Architecture changes, security implications, test strategies
- **Summarize progress regularly**: Especially in long debugging sessions

### Dynamic Configuration Patterns
1. **SystemConfig Integration**: Always use SystemConfig for values that may change (pricing, rates, limits)
2. **Schema Design**: Don't use default values in schemas for dynamic config - fetch from SystemConfig instead
3. **Test Considerations**: Initialize SystemConfig in beforeEach for tests that depend on it
4. **API Response Formatting**: Transform Mongoose documents to consistent API responses

## Improvement Opportunities

### For Future Sessions
1. **Proactive Error Prevention**: 
   - Check test expectations before implementing features
   - Verify environment setup early in OAuth/external service work
   - Run quick smoke tests after major changes

2. **Better Documentation**:
   - Create inline comments for complex logic (OAuth flows, validation rules)
   - Maintain decision logs for architectural choices
   - Document test patterns for future reference

3. **Enhanced Debugging**:
   - Create debugging utilities (test data factories, mock helpers)
   - Build comprehensive error logging for OAuth flows
   - Implement better test isolation patterns from the start

4. **Prompt Evolution**:
   - Suggest additions to this starting prompt when noticing repeated processes for common tasks
   - Capture new workflows and patterns that emerge during sessions
   - Update best practices based on successful problem-solving approaches

## Session Startup Checklist
When we begin each session:
- [ ] Review git status and recent commits
- [ ] **CRITICAL: Review all uncommitted changes and determine if they are still relevant or need to be rolled back**
- [ ] Review the backlog queue in `docs/development/BACKLOG.md` for pending work items
- [ ] **Check for recent project logs in `/project-logs/`**:
  - Look for logs with status "IN PROGRESS"
  - If found, ask: "Found in-progress task: [task name]. Would you like to continue where we left off?"
  - Review the log to understand context and completed steps
- [ ] **Review `docs/development/OPERATING_BEST_PRACTICES.md` for known issues and workarounds**
- [ ] Understand the current task/issue context
- [ ] Identify if this relates to previous work (OAuth, testing, etc.)
- [ ] Establish the success criteria for the session

## Post-Session Completion Checklist
When implementing new features or enhancements:
- [ ] **ALWAYS update or add relevant tests for new functionality**
- [ ] **Ensure all existing related tests still pass**
- [ ] **Update README.md with new features, API changes, or configuration requirements**
- [ ] **Update relevant HTML documentation files in docs/ directory**
- [ ] **Run full test suite to verify no regressions (`npm test`)**
- [ ] **For dynamic pricing/config features**: Verify SystemConfig integration works correctly
- [ ] **For commission calculations**: Test with various scenarios including edge cases
- [ ] **Commit changes with descriptive commit messages**
- [ ] **Push to repository**
- [ ] **Restart server with PM2 to apply changes**

## Backlog Queue Management
The project maintains a `docs/development/BACKLOG.md` file for tracking pending work items:
- **Purpose**: Store tasks and issues identified during sessions for future work
- **Structure**: Items organized by priority (High, Medium, Low) with context
- **Usage**: Review at session start to pick work when no specific task is requested
- **Updates**: Add new items as discovered, move completed items to completed section
- **Reference**: Say "review the backlog queue" to see pending work items

## Communication Preferences
- **Be direct and concise**: Focus on facts and solutions
- **Use parallel tool execution**: Batch operations when possible
- **Ask for clarification**: When requirements are ambiguous
- **Provide options**: Especially for architectural or security decisions
- **Document complex solutions**: For future reference

## Key Principles for Our Collaboration
1. **Systematic over quick fixes**: Take time to understand root causes
2. **Test-driven solutions**: Let failing tests guide our implementation
3. **Security and maintainability**: Never compromise on these fundamentals
4. **Collaborative decision-making**: Complex choices should involve discussion
5. **Continuous improvement**: Learn from each session to work better together

## WaveMAX Application Architecture & Implementation Guide

### 1. **Core Architecture Overview**

**Tech Stack:**
- Backend: Node.js (v16+) with Express.js
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- Authentication: JWT tokens + Passport.js (Google, Facebook, LinkedIn OAuth)
- Testing: Jest with Supertest
- Process Management: PM2
- Payment Processing: Paygistix (hosted form solution)
- Email: Nodemailer with multiple provider support
- Security: Helmet, CSRF protection, rate limiting, input sanitization

**Key Architectural Patterns:**
- RESTful API design with JWT authentication
- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with hierarchical permissions
- Embedded iframe architecture for white-label deployments
- Single-page application router (embed-app-v2.html) for CSP compliance
- Dynamic configuration via SystemConfig model
- Encrypted sensitive data storage (payment info, OAuth tokens)

### 2. **Database Schema & Business Logic**

**Core Models:**
- **Affiliate**: Service providers with geo-based service areas, commission tracking, W-9 tax compliance
- **Customer**: End users linked to affiliates, WDF credit system, bag credit tracking
- **Order**: Multi-stage workflow (pending → processing → processed → complete), bag tracking system
- **Administrator**: System managers with role-based permissions
- **Operator**: Store workers with PIN-based authentication for scanning operations
- **SystemConfig**: Dynamic configuration storage (rates, fees, limits)

**Key Business Rules:**
- Affiliates earn commissions on customer orders (configurable via SystemConfig)
- Delivery fees: minimum fee + per-bag charges (configurable per affiliate)
- WDF Credit: Generated from weight differences, applied to future orders
- Bag tracking: Individual QR codes for multi-stage scanning workflow
- Payment: Handled entirely by Paygistix, no card data stored locally

### 3. **API Structure & Authentication**

**Authentication Flow:**
1. Traditional: username/password → JWT token
2. OAuth: Social provider → profile creation/linking → JWT token
3. Store Operators: PIN-based auth with IP whitelisting support

**Route Organization:**
```
/api/auth/* - Authentication endpoints
/api/affiliates/* - Affiliate management
/api/customers/* - Customer operations
/api/orders/* - Order processing
/api/administrators/* - Admin functions
/api/operators/* - Operator management
/api/system-config/* - Dynamic configuration
/api/payments/* - Payment processing
/api/w9/* - Tax document management
```

**RBAC Hierarchy:**
- admin → administrator → operator → affiliate → customer
- Middleware: `checkRole(['admin', 'administrator'])` for route protection

### 4. **Frontend Architecture**

**Embedding System:**
- Main router: `embed-app-v2.html` - CSP-compliant single-page app
- Dynamic page loading with script injection management
- Parent-iframe communication via postMessage for mobile chrome hiding
- Route mapping in `EMBED_PAGES` configuration

**CSP Compliance:**
- All JavaScript in external files (no inline scripts)
- Nonce-based CSP for dynamic content
- Scripts registered in `pageScripts` mapping for dynamic loading
- Strict CSP applied to all embed pages

**Mobile Support:**
- Automatic chrome hiding on mobile devices
- Viewport management via parent-iframe bridge
- Touch-optimized UI components

### 5. **Security Implementation**

**Multi-Layer Security:**
1. **Authentication**: JWT with blacklist support, token expiry
2. **Authorization**: RBAC with resource ownership checks
3. **Input Validation**: express-validator + Joi schemas
4. **Sanitization**: MongoDB injection prevention, XSS protection
5. **Rate Limiting**: Route-specific limits (auth, API endpoints)
6. **CSRF Protection**: Token-based with conditional application
7. **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for sensitive data (payment info, SSNs)

**Security Headers:**
- Helmet.js configuration
- Custom CSP with frame-ancestors for embedding
- HSTS, X-Frame-Options, Permissions-Policy

### 6. **Testing Patterns**

**Test Organization:**
- Unit tests: `/tests/unit/*` - Model methods, utilities, controllers
- Integration tests: `/tests/integration/*` - Full API endpoint testing
- Test helpers: CSRF token management, auth helpers, test data factories

**Key Testing Patterns:**
```javascript
// CSRF-aware request pattern
const csrfToken = await getCsrfToken(agent);
const response = await agent
  .post('/api/endpoint')
  .set('x-csrf-token', csrfToken)
  .send(data);

// Auth testing pattern
const token = createTestToken(userId, 'affiliate');
await agent.get('/api/protected')
  .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${token}`);
```

### 7. **Configuration & Integration Points**

**SystemConfig Usage:**
```javascript
// Always fetch dynamic values
const wdfRate = await SystemConfig.getValue('wdf_base_rate_per_pound', 1.25);
const maxBags = await SystemConfig.getValue('max_bags_per_order', 10);
```

**External Integrations:**
1. **Paygistix**: Hosted payment forms with callback handling
2. **OAuth Providers**: Google, Facebook, LinkedIn for social auth
3. **DocuSign**: W-9 tax form collection and verification
4. **QuickBooks**: Financial data export (planned)
5. **Email Services**: SMTP, SendGrid, Mailcow support

### 8. **Common Implementation Patterns**

**Error Handling:**
```javascript
try {
  // Operation
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Operation failed:', { 
    error: error.message, 
    userId: req.user?.id,
    context: additionalData 
  });
  return res.status(500).json({ 
    success: false, 
    message: 'User-friendly error message' 
  });
}
```

**Response Format:**
```javascript
// Success
res.json({ 
  success: true, 
  data: result,
  message: 'Operation completed successfully' 
});

// Error
res.status(400).json({ 
  success: false, 
  message: 'Validation error',
  errors: validationErrors 
});
```

**Mongoose Middleware Patterns:**
- Pre-save: Password hashing, data encryption, validation
- Virtual fields: Computed properties (fullName, commissions)
- Careful with `isNew` checks for conditional validation

### 9. **Deployment & Operations**

**PM2 Management:**
- Config: `ecosystem.config.js`
- Commands: `pm2 restart wavemax`, `pm2 logs wavemax`
- Log locations: `/root/.pm2/logs/`

**Environment Variables:**
- Required: MONGODB_URI, JWT_SECRET, ENCRYPTION_KEY
- OAuth: Provider-specific client IDs and secrets
- Paygistix: MERCHANT_ID, FORM_ID, FORM_HASH
- Email: Provider configuration

### 10. **Critical Implementation Notes**

**Always Remember:**
1. Use SystemConfig for ALL configurable values (rates, fees, limits)
2. Test in both direct access AND embedded contexts
3. Add scripts to pageScripts mapping in embed-app-v2.html
4. Maintain translations for all 4 languages (en, es, pt, de)
5. Use external JavaScript files only (CSP compliance)
6. Follow existing patterns in neighboring code
7. Run tests before committing changes
8. Check for regression in related functionality
9. Validate all user inputs thoroughly
10. Log security-relevant events to audit log

**Common Pitfalls to Avoid:**
1. Hardcoding business values instead of using SystemConfig
2. Adding inline JavaScript (blocked by CSP)
3. Forgetting to update pageScripts mapping for embedded pages
4. Not testing OAuth flows with real providers
5. Storing sensitive data without encryption
6. Missing CSRF tokens in state-changing requests
7. Not handling floating-point precision in financial calculations
8. Forgetting to initialize SystemConfig in tests
