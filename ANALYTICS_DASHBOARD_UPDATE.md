# Analytics Dashboard Update Summary

## Date: January 11, 2025

### Changes Implemented:

1. **Fixed Translation Warnings**
   - Added missing translation keys for order status labels in all languages (en, es, pt, de):
     - pending, scheduled, processing, processed, complete, cancelled
   - Added "dateRange" translation key for the date range filter header

2. **Updated Processing Time Chart**
   - Changed from "Processing Time Distribution" to "Daily Average Completion Time"
   - Now calculates time from `scheduledAt` to `completedAt` (instead of processing time)
   - Changed from bar chart to line chart showing daily averages
   - Fixed calculation in backend to properly compute completion time in minutes

3. **Global Date Range Filter**
   - Added a global date range toggle at the top of the analytics tab
   - Options: Today, Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days (default)
   - Single filter applies to all analytics charts and metrics
   - Removed individual chart subtitles since date range is now shown globally

4. **API Improvements**
   - Enhanced `/api/v1/orders/search` endpoint to support date filtering
   - Added `startDate`, `endDate`, and `status` query parameters
   - Fixed authorization to accept both 'admin' and 'administrator' roles

### Implementation Details:

**Frontend Changes:**
- `/public/assets/js/administrator-dashboard-init.js`
  - Updated `loadAnalytics()` to accept date range parameter
  - Modified `setupDateRangeToggle()` to reload all analytics on selection
  - Changed chart rendering to show completion time instead of processing time

**Backend Changes:**
- `/server/controllers/administratorController.js`
  - Updated `getOrderAnalytics` to calculate completion time from scheduled to completed
  - Modified aggregation pipeline to use correct timestamp fields

- `/server/controllers/orderController.js`
  - Enhanced `searchOrders` to support date range and status filtering
  - Fixed role authorization to accept administrators

**Translation Files:**
- Added missing keys to all language files (en, es, pt, de)
- Ensured consistent translations across all supported languages

### Testing:
- Analytics functionality tested with different date ranges
- Order status distribution updates correctly based on selected period
- Completion time calculations verified to show proper averages

### Notes:
- Default date range is set to "Last 30 Days" as requested
- All charts respect the global date range selection
- API endpoints efficiently filter data server-side rather than loading entire datasets
