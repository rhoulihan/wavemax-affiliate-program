# DocuSign JWT Authentication Troubleshooting

## Current Status
- ✅ Consent granted successfully
- ✅ JWT token generated correctly
- ❌ Authentication failing with "no_valid_keys_or_signatures"

## Things to Check in DocuSign Admin

### 1. Verify User ID
- Go to **Admin Console > Users**
- Find your user and click on it
- Copy the **User ID** (GUID) and verify it matches: `1216a2b8-e086-4414-bec7-584ea09923b4`
- If it doesn't match, update the .env file

### 2. Check App Status
- Go to **Apps and Keys**
- Verify the app is **Active** (not in development/test mode)
- Check if there are any warnings or errors

### 3. RSA Key Issues
When you added the public key:
- Did you paste it EXACTLY as shown (including BEGIN/END lines)?
- No extra spaces at the beginning or end?
- No line breaks in the middle of the key content?

### 4. Common Solutions
1. **Wait a few minutes** - Sometimes DocuSign takes time to propagate changes
2. **Try deleting and re-creating the entire app** in DocuSign
3. **Generate a completely new key pair** and start fresh

### 5. Alternative Test
Go to: https://developers.docusign.com/tools/api-request-builder
- Log in with your DocuSign account
- Get a temporary access token
- We can hardcode it temporarily to test if the rest of the integration works

## Next Steps
If none of the above work, we might need to:
1. Contact DocuSign support with the trace token: `95a6b72b-d3d2-42fe-b5f7-e7677973c49d`
2. Try creating a new app from scratch
3. Use Authorization Code Grant instead of JWT
