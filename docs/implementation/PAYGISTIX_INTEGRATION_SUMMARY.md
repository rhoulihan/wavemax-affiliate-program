# Paygistix Payment Integration Summary

## Date: January 11, 2025

### Overview
Created a complete embedded payment control system using the Paygistix form code generator output. This integration allows WaveMAX to process payments through Paygistix's secure payment gateway.

### Components Created:

1. **Payment Form Component** (`/public/assets/js/paygistix-payment-form.js`)
   - Reusable JavaScript class for embedding payment forms
   - Handles form rendering, validation, and total calculation
   - Supports pre-filling amounts based on order details
   - Includes styling and responsive design

2. **Payment Embed Page** (`/public/paygistix-payment-embed.html`)
   - Standalone page for processing payments
   - Loads order details and pre-fills payment form
   - Shows order summary before payment
   - Handles communication with parent window if embedded

3. **Payment Success Page** (`/public/payment-success-embed.html`)
   - Shows confirmation after successful payment
   - Displays order and transaction details
   - Provides links to view order or return to dashboard
   - Notifies parent window of success

4. **Payment Error Page** (`/public/payment-error-embed.html`)
   - Shows error details when payment fails
   - Provides helpful next steps and retry options
   - Includes support contact information
   - Notifies parent window of failure

5. **Payment Callback Route** (`/server/routes/paymentCallbackRoute.js`)
   - Handles GET and POST callbacks from Paygistix
   - Updates payment and order status
   - Sends confirmation emails
   - Logs audit trail
   - Redirects to success/error pages

### Return URL Configuration

The return URL that should be used in the Paygistix form generator is:

```
https://www.wavemaxlaundry.com/api/v1/payment_callback
```

Or for the affiliate program domain:
```
https://wavemax.promo/api/v1/payment_callback
```

### Integration Points:

1. **Order Creation Flow**:
   - Create order → Redirect to payment page
   - Payment page loads order details
   - Pre-fills service amounts based on order

2. **Payment Processing Flow**:
   - Customer fills form → Submits to Paygistix
   - Paygistix processes → Calls return URL
   - Callback updates order → Redirects to success/error

3. **Service Codes Supported**:
   - WDF: Wash Dry Fold Service ($1.25/lb)
   - DF5-DF20: Per bag delivery fees ($5-$20)
   - MC25-MC75: Minimum delivery fees ($25-$75)

### Usage Example:

```javascript
// Initialize payment form
const paymentForm = new PaygistixPaymentForm('container-id', {
    orderId: 'ORD-2025-001',
    customerId: 'CUST-123',
    orderDetails: {
        estimatedWeight: 50,
        numberOfBags: 3,
        deliveryFee: 30,
        estimatedTotal: 92.50
    },
    returnURL: '/api/v1/payment_callback',
    onSuccess: function() {
        console.log('Payment initiated');
    }
});

// Pre-fill amounts
paymentForm.setPrefilledAmounts({
    WDF: 50,  // 50 lbs
    MC30: 1   // $30 minimum fee
});
```

### Security Considerations:

1. **Hash Verification**: The hash value in the form needs to be properly generated by Paygistix
2. **HTTPS Required**: All payment pages must be served over HTTPS
3. **Token Storage**: Sensitive payment data is never stored locally
4. **Audit Logging**: All payment events are logged for compliance

### Next Steps:

1. Obtain proper hash value from Paygistix for production
2. Configure webhook URL in Paygistix merchant portal
3. Test end-to-end payment flow in sandbox environment
4. Implement additional payment method support (ACH, saved cards)
5. Add refund functionality to admin dashboard
