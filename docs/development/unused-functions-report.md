# Unused Functions Report

## Summary
This report identifies functions and methods that are defined but never called in the WaveMAX affiliate program codebase.

## Unused Functions Found

### 1. Middleware Functions

#### auth.js
- **validateRequest**: An exported function that creates validation middleware but is never used in any route file.

#### rbac.js
- **checkAllRoles**: An exported function for checking if a user has all required roles, but only defined and never used.
- **checkOperatorStatus**: An exported function for checking operator status, but only defined and never used.
- **checkResourceOwnership**: An exported function for checking resource ownership, but only defined and never used.
- **filterResponseFields**: An exported function for filtering response fields based on permissions, but only defined and never used.

### 2. Utility Functions

#### emailService.js
- **formatSize**: An internal helper function defined on line 730 that formats size strings for display in emails, but is never called anywhere in the file.

#### encryption.js
- **generateBarcode**: An exported function for generating barcodes, but is never used in any part of the codebase.

#### passwordValidator.js
- **passwordValidationMiddleware**: An exported middleware function for password validation that is never used in any route.
- **isPasswordInHistory**: An exported function for checking password history that is never used.
- **getPasswordStrength**: An exported function that generates password strength scores, but is never used outside of the passwordValidator file itself.
- **commonPasswords**: An exported array of common passwords that is never imported or used elsewhere.

#### fieldFilter.js
- **filterFields**: An exported function for filtering object fields, but only used internally within fieldFilter.js.
- **filterArray**: An exported function for filtering arrays of objects, but only used internally within fieldFilter.js.
- **responseFilter**: An exported middleware function for automatic response filtering that is never used in any route.

### 3. Controller Functions
All controller functions appear to be used in their respective route files.

## Recommendations

1. **Remove unused functions**: The following functions can be safely removed as they are not used anywhere:
   - `auth.validateRequest`
   - `rbac.checkAllRoles`
   - `rbac.checkOperatorStatus`
   - `rbac.checkResourceOwnership`
   - `rbac.filterResponseFields`
   - `emailService.formatSize`
   - `encryption.generateBarcode`
   - `passwordValidator.passwordValidationMiddleware`
   - `passwordValidator.isPasswordInHistory`
   - `passwordValidator.getPasswordStrength`
   - `passwordValidator.commonPasswords`
   - `fieldFilter.responseFilter`

2. **Review internal functions**: Some functions like `filterFields` and `filterArray` in fieldFilter.js are only used internally. Consider making them private (not exported) if they're not intended for external use.

3. **Consider implementation**: Some of these unused functions appear to be planned features that were never implemented:
   - Password history checking (`isPasswordInHistory`)
   - Resource ownership checking (`checkResourceOwnership`)
   - Response field filtering middleware (`responseFilter`)
   
   Decide whether to implement these features or remove the code.

## Code Maintenance Impact

Removing these unused functions would:
- Reduce code complexity and maintenance burden
- Improve code coverage metrics
- Make the codebase cleaner and easier to understand
- Reduce bundle size slightly

## Next Steps

1. Verify this analysis by running additional checks
2. Create a plan to either implement or remove these unused functions
3. Update tests accordingly if functions are removed
4. Document any decisions about keeping certain functions for future use
