# Bag Tracking Implementation Plan

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED (July 2025)

### Implementation Summary
This bag tracking system has been successfully implemented and deployed. The following features were completed:

1. **UUID-based Bag Identification**: Each bag now has a unique UUID generated when customer cards are printed
2. **Order-Level Bag Tracking**: Bags are tracked within order documents with status progression (processing → processed → completed)
3. **Duplicate Scan Prevention**: System prevents duplicate scanning at each stage with warning modals
4. **Batch Operations**: Weighing and pickup operations use efficient batch processing
5. **Modal State Management**: Robust modal workflows prevent errors and maintain state integrity
6. **QR Code Updates**: New format implemented: `{custId}#{bagId}` for bag cards
7. **Automated Notifications**: Order completion triggers customer and affiliate notifications automatically
8. **Complete API Implementation**: All planned endpoints (weigh-bags, scan-processed, complete-pickup) are operational
9. **Frontend Integration**: All modals and scanning interfaces have been updated and tested
10. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all edge cases including invalid QR formats and duplicate scans

All planned features have been successfully implemented, tested, and deployed to production. The system is now actively tracking bags across all order stages, improving accuracy and preventing processing errors.

*The following documentation is preserved for historical reference and technical details of the implementation.*

## Overview
Implement a bag tracking system within order context to prevent duplicate scanning and ensure all bags are properly processed through each stage of the workflow. Each bag has a unique ID and tracks its state (processing, processed, completed) within the order.

## Key Requirements
1. Generate unique UUID bagId when printing customer cards
2. Track bags in an array on the Order document
3. Prevent duplicate scanning at each stage
4. Use existing order states: processing, processed, completed
5. Show warning modals for duplicate scans
6. Trigger order completion actions when all bags are processed
7. Use custId to find most recent order (existing workflow)
8. Batch operations for efficiency (weighing and pickup)
9. Modal state management to prevent errors

## Database Schema Changes

### Order Model Updates
```javascript
// Add to Order schema
bags: [{
  bagId: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
    unique: true,
    index: true
  },
  bagNumber: {
    type: Number,
    required: true
  },
  status: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['processing', 'processed', 'completed'],
    default: 'processing'
  },
  weight: {
    type: Number,
    default: 0
  },
  scannedAt: {
    processing: Date,
    processed: Date,
    completed: Date
  },
  scannedBy: {
    processing: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Operator' },
    processed: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Operator' },
    completed: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'Operator' }
  }
}]
```

## Bag ID Generation Strategy

### Format: UUID v4
- Example: `f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479`
- Globally unique identifier
- No order dependency (bags are reusable across orders)
- Generated once when bag card is printed

### Implementation:
```javascript
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');

function generateBagId() {
  return uuidv4();
}
```

## QR Code Updates

### Current Order QR Format:
```
{orderNumber}
```

### New Bag QR Format:
```
{custId}#{bagId}
```

### QR Code Types:
- **Order Cards**: Continue using `{orderNumber}` format
- **Bag Cards**: New format `{custId}#{bagId}` (e.g., `CUST-12345#f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479`)
- Uses # delimiter to separate custId from bagId
- custId enables finding most recent order using existing workflow

## Scanning Workflow Updates

### 1. Bag Check-in/Weighing Stage
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/orders/weigh-bags`
```javascript
{
  "bags": [
    {
      "bagId": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479",
      "weight": 10.5
    },
    {
      "bagId": "a8c9d2e5-12ab-4567-b890-1234567890ab", 
      "weight": 8.3
    }
  ],
  "orderId": "ORD-2025-0001",
  "operatorId": "op123"
}
```

**Workflow**:
1. Operator scans first bag QR code `{custId}#{bagId}`
2. System parses custId and finds most recent order
3. Weigh bags modal opens showing order details
4. Operator scans and weighs each bag:
   - Parse bagId from QR code
   - Add to temporary list with weight
   - Prevent duplicate scans within modal
5. When all bags weighed, operator confirms
6. System batch appends all bags to order with 'processing' status
7. Update order.bagsWeighed = true

**Modal State Management**:
```javascript
// Temporary state during weighing
modalState = {
  orderId: "ORD-2025-0001",
  customerId: "CUST-12345",
  scannedBags: new Set(), // Prevent duplicates
  bags: [
    { bagId: "...", weight: 10.5 },
    { bagId: "...", weight: 8.3 }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Post-WDF Scanning Stage
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/orders/scan-processed`
```javascript
{
  "qrCode": "CUST-12345#f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479",
  "operatorId": "op123"
}
```

**Workflow**:
1. Operator scans bag QR code after WDF processing
2. System parses custId and bagId
3. Find order containing this bagId in bags array
4. Check bag status:
   - If 'processing', update to 'processed'
   - If 'processed' and not all bags processed, show warning modal
   - If 'processed' and all bags processed, show pickup modal
   - If 'completed', show pickup modal
5. Check if all bags in order are now 'processed'
6. If yes, trigger completion actions:
   - Send customer notification email
   - Send affiliate commission email
   - Update order.readyForPickup = true
   - Log commission earned

**Response Types**:
- Success: Bag marked as processed
- Warning: Bag already processed (with count of remaining bags)
- Ready: All bags processed, order ready for pickup

### 3. Pickup Scanning Stage
**Endpoint**: `POST /api/v1/orders/complete-pickup`
```javascript
{
  "bagIds": [
    "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479",
    "a8c9d2e5-12ab-4567-b890-1234567890ab"
  ],
  "orderId": "ORD-2025-0001",
  "operatorId": "op123"
}
```

**Workflow**:
1. When any processed/completed bag is scanned
2. System shows pickup modal with order details
3. Operator scans each bag for pickup:
   - Modal maintains Set() of scanned bagIds
   - Prevents duplicate scans within modal
   - Shows progress (2/3 bags scanned)
4. When all bags scanned, operator confirms
5. System batch updates all bags to 'completed' status
6. Update order status to 'completed'
7. Update order.pickedUp = true

**Pickup Modal State**:
```javascript
pickupModalState = {
  orderId: "ORD-2025-0001",
  customer: "John Doe",
  totalBags: 3,
  scannedBags: new Set(["bagId1", "bagId2"]), // Prevent duplicates
  remainingBags: 1
}
```

## Response Formats

    "bagId": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479",
    "bagNumber": 1,
    "status": "processing",
    "weight": 10.5
  },
  "orderProgress": {
    "totalBags": 3,

## Frontend Modal Updates

### Weigh Bags Modal:
```javascript
{
  title: "Weigh Bags - Order {orderNumber}",
  customer: "{customerName}",
  scannedBags: [
    { bagId: "...", weight: 10.5 },
    { bagId: "...", weight: 8.3 }
  ],
  duplicateWarning: false, // Shows if duplicate scan attempted
  buttons: ["Confirm All Bags Weighed", "Cancel"]
}
```

### Duplicate Scan Warning Modal:
```javascript
{
  title: "Bag Already Processed",
  message: "This bag has already been processed. {remainingCount} bags still need processing.",
  bagNumber: 2,
  processedAt: "10:30 AM",
  type: "warning",
  buttons: ["OK"]
}
```

### Order Ready for Pickup Modal:
```javascript
{
  title: "Order Ready for Pickup",
  message: "Scan all {totalBags} bags to complete pickup",
  customer: "{customerName}",
  orderNumber: "{orderNumber}",
  progress: "{scannedCount}/{totalBags} bags scanned",
  scannedBags: ["bagId1", "bagId2"],
  duplicateWarning: false, // Shows if duplicate scan attempted
  type: "success",
  buttons: ["Complete Pickup", "Cancel"]
}
```

## Customer Card Printing Update

### Print Card Function Modification
```javascript
// Current: prints {customerId}
function printCustomerCard(customerId) {
  const qrCode = customerId;
  // ... print logic
}

// New: appends random UUID for bag tracking
function printCustomerCard(customerId) {
  const bagId = uuidv4();
  const qrCode = `${customerId}#${bagId}`;
  // ... print logic
}
```

### Implementation Files to Modify

- Handle duplicate scans within modals
- Show inline warning without closing modal
- Maintain modal state integrity

### Database Errors:
- Retry logic for transient failures
- Clear error messages to operators
- Fallback to manual process if needed

## Testing Scenarios

1. **Normal Flow**:
   - Scan 3 bags at check-in
   - Scan 3 bags after WDF
   - Verify completion actions trigger

2. **Duplicate Scans**:
   - Scan same bag twice at check-in
   - Scan processed bag again
   - Verify warnings appear

3. **Mixed Scanning**:
   - Scan bags out of order
   - Skip a bag and scan others
   - Verify tracking accuracy

4. **Error Cases**:
   - Invalid bagId format
   - Non-existent bagId
   - Database connection issues

## Performance Considerations

1. **Indexing**:
   - Index bagId field for fast lookups
   - Compound index on orderNumber + bagId

2. **Caching**:
   - Cache order data during active scanning
   - Clear cache after completion

3. **Batch Operations**:
   - Update multiple bags in single operation
   - Minimize database round trips

## Security Considerations

1. **Validation**:
   - Validate bagId format
   - Verify operator permissions
   - Prevent injection attacks

2. **Audit Trail**:
   - Log all bag state changes
   - Track operator actions
   - Maintain scanning history

3. **Data Integrity**:
   - Ensure bagId uniqueness
   - Prevent race conditions
   - Handle concurrent scans

## Important Workflow Changes

### Check-in Process
1. **Current**: Scan order/customer card, enter total weight
2. **New**: 
   - Scan any bag (system finds most recent order via custId)
   - Weigh bags modal opens
   - Scan and weigh each bag individually
   - Confirm when all bags weighed
   - System batch appends bags to order

### Processing (Post-WDF)
1. **Current**: Scan order card to mark complete
2. **New**: 
   - Scan each bag individually
   - System tracks which bags are processed
   - Warning if scanning already processed bag
   - Auto-sends notifications when all bags processed

### Pickup Process
1. **Current**: Scan order card to complete pickup
2. **New**:
   - Scan any bag from order (triggers pickup modal)
   - Scan all bags to verify pickup
   - Confirm to complete order
   - Both bags and order marked complete

### Key Benefits
1. **Accuracy**: Each bag tracked individually
2. **Prevention**: No duplicate processing or missing bags
3. **Efficiency**: Batch operations reduce database calls
4. **Visibility**: Clear progress tracking per bag
5. **Reliability**: Modal state management prevents errors

## Suggested Improvements

### 1. Order-Level Validation
- Prevent duplicate bag assignments within order
- Validate total weight consistency
- Alert if bag count seems unusual

### 2. Weight Validation
- Set min/max weight thresholds per bag
- Alert if weight seems unusual
- Allow supervisor override for edge cases

### 3. Enhanced Error Recovery
- Allow removing a bag from weighing modal before confirmation
- Ability to edit bag weights before confirmation
- Ability to void and restart check-in process

### 4. Order Analytics
- Track average bags per order
- Monitor processing time per bag
- Identify orders with weight discrepancies

### 5. Operator Experience
- Sound/vibration feedback on successful scan
- Visual progress indicators in modals
- Auto-advance to next field after scan
- Clear indication of which bags have been scanned

## Questions for Review

1. Should we limit the number of bags per order?
2. How should we handle bag removal during the weighing modal?
3. Do we need bag-specific notes or attributes (e.g., "delicates", "heavy items")?
4. Should bag weights be editable after initial scan but before confirmation?
5. What happens if wrong bag is scanned during an order?
6. Do we need a supervisor override for bag-related operations?
7. Should bags have a maximum weight limit that triggers a warning?
8. How should we handle partial pickups (customer only takes some bags)?
9. Should we show running weight total in the weighing modal?
10. Do we need ability to merge/split orders based on bags?
