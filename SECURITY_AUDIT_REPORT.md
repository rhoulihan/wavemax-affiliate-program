# WaveMAX Affiliate Program Security Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-07-14  
**Auditor:** Security Expert (Node.js/Express & Web Application Security Specialist)  
**Scope:** Comprehensive security assessment of the WaveMAX Laundry Affiliate Program web application

## Executive Summary

This security audit identified several critical and high-severity vulnerabilities in the WaveMAX Affiliate Program that require immediate attention. The application demonstrates good security foundations with proper password hashing, input sanitization middleware, and rate limiting. However, critical issues in authentication bypass, injection vulnerabilities, and session management pose significant risks.

### Critical Findings Summary
- **4 Critical** vulnerabilities requiring immediate fix
- **6 High** severity issues needing urgent attention  
- **5 Medium** severity vulnerabilities
- **4 Low** severity issues

## Critical Vulnerabilities (Immediate Action Required)

### 1. Store IP Authentication Bypass
**Location:** `/server/middleware/auth.js` lines 55-92  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Description:** Expired JWT tokens from whitelisted store IPs are automatically renewed without re-authentication, providing permanent access from store locations.  
**Impact:** Compromised store locations could maintain indefinite access to the system.  
**Recommendation:** Remove automatic token renewal or require re-authentication after expiry.

### 2. NoSQL Injection via Regex
**Location:** Multiple controllers (affiliateController.js, orderController.js, customerController.js)  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Description:** User input is directly used in MongoDB `$regex` queries without escaping, allowing ReDoS attacks and query manipulation.  
**Impact:** Database query manipulation, denial of service, potential data exposure.  
**Recommendation:** Implement regex escaping function:
```javascript
function escapeRegex(string) {
  return string.replace(/[.*+?^${}()|[\]\\]/g, '\\$&');
}
```

### 3. OAuth Access Token Storage in Plain Text
**Location:** `/server/config/passport-config.js` lines 41-42, 122-123, 371-372  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Description:** OAuth access tokens and refresh tokens are stored unencrypted in the database.  
**Impact:** Database breach would expose user tokens for all OAuth providers.  
**Recommendation:** Encrypt tokens before storage using the existing encryption utility.

### 4. Open Redirect Vulnerability
**Location:** `/server.js` line 120  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Description:** HTTPS redirect uses user-controlled `host` header without validation.  
**Impact:** Phishing attacks through trusted domain redirects.  
**Recommendation:** Validate host header against whitelist before redirecting.

## High Severity Vulnerabilities

### 1. CORS Null Origin Bypass
**Location:** `/server.js` line 286  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Description:** Requests with no origin header bypass CORS checks entirely.  
**Impact:** Any client can bypass CORS protection by omitting the origin header.  
**Recommendation:** Explicitly handle null origin cases with proper validation.

### 2. Missing CSRF Protection on Critical Endpoints
**Location:** `/server/config/csrf-config.js` - AUTH_ENDPOINTS, REGISTRATION_ENDPOINTS  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Description:** Authentication and registration endpoints have no CSRF protection.  
**Impact:** CSRF attacks could force users to authenticate or register accounts.  
**Recommendation:** Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing operations.

### 3. Weak OAuth State Parameter
**Location:** `/server/controllers/authController.js` lines 992-1000  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Description:** OAuth state parameter validation is insufficient to prevent CSRF.  
**Impact:** OAuth authentication flows vulnerable to CSRF attacks.  
**Recommendation:** Generate cryptographically secure state parameters and validate properly.

### 4. Admin Rate Limit Bypass
**Location:** `/server/middleware/rateLimiting.js` line 99  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Description:** Admin users completely bypass API rate limiting.  
**Impact:** Compromised admin accounts can perform unlimited requests.  
**Recommendation:** Apply reasonable rate limits to admin users.

### 5. Session Fixation Vulnerability
**Location:** Authentication flow - no session regeneration  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Description:** Sessions are not regenerated after successful authentication.  
**Impact:** Attackers can fixate session IDs before victim authentication.  
**Recommendation:** Regenerate session ID after successful login.

### 6. Sensitive Data in Error Responses
**Location:** `/server/middleware/errorHandler.js` lines 115-121  
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Description:** Stack traces exposed in non-production environments.  
**Impact:** Internal system information disclosure.  
**Recommendation:** Ensure NODE_ENV=production in all deployed environments.

## Medium Severity Vulnerabilities

### 1. CSP unsafe-eval Allowed
**Location:** `/server.js` line 247  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Description:** Content Security Policy allows 'unsafe-eval' for non-strict pages.  
**Impact:** Increases XSS attack surface.  
**Recommendation:** Remove unsafe-eval and refactor any code requiring it.

### 2. Inconsistent Password Hashing
**Location:** Different hashing methods for different user types  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Description:** Affiliates use PBKDF2, Administrators use bcrypt, Operators use PINs.  
**Impact:** Confusion in implementation, potential security gaps.  
**Recommendation:** Standardize on bcrypt for all password hashing.

### 3. Missing File Upload Validation
**Location:** No multer configuration found  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Description:** While file uploads are handled by DocuSign, no validation exists for future implementations.  
**Impact:** Potential for malicious file uploads if feature is added.  
**Recommendation:** Implement file type and size validation for any file upload features.

### 4. Third-Party Library Risks
**Location:** `/public/assets/js/jspdf.min.js`  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Description:** Minified third-party libraries with prototype manipulation.  
**Impact:** Potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities.  
**Recommendation:** Keep libraries updated and monitor for security advisories.

### 5. Weak Session Configuration
**Location:** Session configuration  
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Description:** Session cookies may not have all security flags set.  
**Impact:** Session hijacking through XSS or network sniffing.  
**Recommendation:** Ensure httpOnly, secure, and sameSite flags are set.

## Low Severity Issues

### 1. Information Disclosure in Logs
**Location:** Various controllers and utilities  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Description:** Sensitive information like email addresses logged.  
**Impact:** Log file compromise could expose user data.  
**Recommendation:** Implement structured logging with PII filtering.

### 2. Missing Security Headers
**Location:** Security headers configuration  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Description:** Missing Referrer-Policy and Permissions-Policy headers.  
**Impact:** Minor privacy and security improvements missed.  
**Recommendation:** Add comprehensive security headers.

### 3. Hardcoded MongoDB URLs in Scripts
**Location:** Various script files  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Description:** Scripts contain hardcoded MongoDB connection strings.  
**Impact:** Accidental exposure of database location.  
**Recommendation:** Use environment variables exclusively.

### 4. Partial Token Logging
**Location:** `/public/assets/js/operator-scan-init.js`  
**Severity:** LOW  
**Description:** JWT token substrings logged to console.  
**Impact:** Partial token exposure in browser console.  
**Recommendation:** Never log any part of authentication tokens.
