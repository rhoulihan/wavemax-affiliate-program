# WaveMAX Coverage Analysis Report

Last Updated: January 6, 2025

## Current Coverage Status

- **Statements**: 77.4% (target: 80%) - 2.6% below threshold
- **Branches**: 69.68% (target: 80%) - 10.32% below threshold  
- **Functions**: 82.19% (target: 80%) - âœ… Above threshold
- **Lines**: 77.28% (target: 80%) - 2.72% below threshold

## Recent Improvements

Since the last report (December 6, 2024):
- Overall statement coverage improved from 75.04% to 77.4% (+2.36%)
- Branch coverage improved from 68.2% to 69.68% (+1.48%)
- Function coverage improved from 82.05% to 82.19% (+0.14%)
- Added 79 new tests (from 1051 to 1130 total tests)
- Added 3 new test suites (from 48 to 51 total)

### Major Wins
- **encryption.js**: Achieved 100% coverage (up from 68.18%)
- **passport-config.js**: Achieved 100% statement coverage (up from 14.54%)
- **passportConfig.test.js**: New comprehensive test suite added
- **encryptionEnhanced.test.js**: Added enhanced encryption tests

## Critical Gaps Remaining

### ðŸ”´ Urgent Priority (< 50% coverage)
1. **emailService.js** - 0% coverage (746 lines)
   - Most critical gap - handles all system emails
   - Estimated effort: 3-4 hours

2. **coverageRoutes.js** - 42.42% coverage
   - Development-only routes, lower priority
   - Consider excluding from coverage requirements

### ðŸŸ¡ High Priority (50-75% coverage)
1. **authController.js** - 71.26% coverage
   - OAuth session handling functions need tests
   - Social registration flows untested

2. **administratorController.js** - 68.3% coverage
   - Error handling and audit logging gaps

3. **socialAuthRoutes.js** - 56.25% coverage
   - Route configuration checks need coverage

4. **systemConfigRoutes.js** - 63.82% coverage
   - Admin endpoints and initialization untested

## Failing Tests

9 systemConfig integration tests are currently failing and need immediate attention:
- Public endpoint configuration retrieval
- Admin configuration management
- Configuration value updates and validation
- SystemConfig integration with Order model

## Action Plan to Reach 80% Coverage

### Immediate Actions (10-15 hours total)
1. **Create emailService tests** (5% coverage gain)
2. **Fix systemConfig test failures** (1% coverage gain)
3. **Improve branch coverage** in controllers (5% branch coverage gain)
4. **Test OAuth session handling** in authController (2% coverage gain)

### Quick Wins
- Focus on branch coverage in files with high statement coverage but low branch coverage
- Target error handling paths in controllers
- Add edge case tests for validation logic

## Accessing the Report

### Development/Test Environment
Simply navigate to: `/coverage`

### Production Environment
Add the secret key to access: `/coverage?key=YOUR_COVERAGE_ACCESS_KEY`

Set the `COVERAGE_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable to enable production access.

## Report Contents

- **[index.html](index.html)** - Main coverage analysis dashboard
- **[action-plan.html](action-plan.html)** - Detailed sprint planning and priorities
- **[critical-files.html](critical-files.html)** - Deep dive into files needing attention
- **[test-templates.html](test-templates.html)** - Ready-to-use test templates

## Security Features

1. **Iframe Protection**: Reports cannot be accessed from embedded contexts
2. **Environment Check**: Automatically available in development/test
3. **Secret Key**: Required for production access
4. **X-Frame-Options**: Set to DENY to prevent embedding

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm test -- --coverage` to verify current status
2. Focus on emailService.js for biggest coverage gain
3. Fix failing systemConfig tests
4. Target branch coverage improvements in controllers

With focused effort on these areas, the project should reach the 80% coverage threshold within 10-15 hours of dedicated testing work.
