# Bag Removal Process

## Overview
This directory contains the plan and tools for removing bag tracking functionality from the WaveMAX system while preserving bag purchase credits.

## Files Created

1. **`bag-removal-plan.json`** - The main state tracking file
   - Tracks all tasks and their completion status
   - Organized into 6 phases
   - Can be resumed if process is interrupted

2. **`bag-removal-details.md`** - Detailed implementation notes
   - Technical considerations
   - Potential issues and solutions
   - Migration scripts
   - Verification checklist

3. **`bag-removal-executor.js`** - Execution management script
   - Tracks progress
   - Executes tasks safely
   - Provides status reports
   - Can be resumed after interruption

4. **`bag-removal.log`** - Execution log (created when script runs)
   - Timestamps for all actions
   - Error tracking
   - Audit trail

## Quick Start

### Check Current Status
```bash
node bag-removal-executor.js status
```

### Execute Next Task
```bash
node bag-removal-executor.js next
```

### Run Verification Tests
```bash
node bag-removal-executor.js verify
```

## Process Overview

### Phase 1: Update Related Models (4 tasks)
- Remove bagIDs from Order model
- Update controllers that reference bags

### Phase 2: Remove Routes and Controller (5 tasks)
- Remove bag routes from server.js
- Delete bag controller and routes files

### Phase 3: Remove Bag Model (1 task)
- Delete the Bag model file

### Phase 4: Update Tests (5 tasks)
- Remove all bag-related tests
- Update model tests

### Phase 5: Update Frontend/Docs (7 tasks)
- Remove bag UI elements
- Update documentation
- Remove email templates

### Phase 6: Database Cleanup (3 tasks)
- Migration scripts
- Drop bags collection
- Verify credits preserved

## Safety Features

1. **Incremental Execution** - Each task is executed individually
2. **Status Tracking** - Progress saved after each task
3. **Confirmation Required** - Manual confirmation before changes
4. **Rollback Plan** - Git and database backup strategy
5. **Verification Tests** - Automated and manual checks

## Important Notes

- **Backup First**: Ensure database is backed up before starting
- **Feature Branch**: Work on a feature branch, not main
- **Test Coverage**: Monitor test coverage after each phase
- **Credits Preserved**: Bag purchase credits remain intact
- **No Data Loss**: Only tracking is removed, not purchase history

## Recovery Process

If interrupted:
1. Run `node bag-removal-executor.js status` to see progress
2. Review `bag-removal.log` for any errors
3. Continue with `node bag-removal-executor.js next`
4. If a task failed, manually fix and update status in plan.json

## Manual Task Execution

If you prefer manual execution:
1. Open `bag-removal-plan.json`
2. Follow tasks in order
3. Update task status to "completed" after each
4. Update progress counts
5. Run verification tests between phases
