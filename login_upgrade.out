WAVEMAX AFFILIATE PROGRAM - LOGIN UPGRADE PROJECT LOG
=======================================================
Project Started: 2025-05-31
Objective: Implement strong passwords for all logins + social media authentication for affiliates

COMPREHENSIVE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
=================================

PHASE 1: STRONG PASSWORD IMPLEMENTATION
--------------------------------------
1.1 PASSWORD REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION
   - Minimum 12 characters (increased from current 8)
   - Must contain uppercase letters (A-Z)
   - Must contain lowercase letters (a-z) 
   - Must contain numbers (0-9)
   - Must contain special characters (!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;:,.<>?)
   - Cannot contain common patterns (123456, password, qwerty, etc.)
   - Cannot be the same as username or email
   - Cannot reuse last 3 passwords (for administrators/operators)

1.2 IMPLEMENTATION AREAS
   - Update validation in authController.js for all user types
   - Enhance middleware/auth.js password validation
   - Update models for password history tracking (admins/operators)
   - Modify registration forms and validation
   - Update password reset functionality

1.3 USER TYPE SPECIFIC UPDATES
   - Affiliates: username/password login + social options
   - Customers: username/password (strong validation)
   - Administrators: email/password (strong + history tracking)
   - Operators: email/password (strong + history tracking)

PHASE 2: SOCIAL MEDIA AUTHENTICATION
-----------------------------------
2.1 OAUTH PROVIDERS TO IMPLEMENT
   - Google OAuth 2.0 (primary - most trusted by businesses)
   - Facebook Login (high user adoption)
   - LinkedIn OAuth (professional network - good for affiliate businesses)

2.2 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
   - Install passport, passport-google-oauth20, passport-facebook, passport-linkedin-oauth2
   - Configure OAuth strategies and callback URLs
   - Update Affiliate model to store social media account links
   - Create social auth registration flow
   - Add provider selection to registration UI
   - Implement account linking for existing users

2.3 CONFIGURATION REQUIREMENTS
   - Environment variables for OAuth client IDs/secrets
   - Callback URL configuration
   - Scope definitions for each provider
   - Error handling for OAuth failures

PHASE 3: TESTING AND VALIDATION
------------------------------
3.1 PASSWORD TESTING
   - Update all existing tests to use strong passwords
   - Test password validation edge cases
   - Test password history functionality
   - Verify backward compatibility

3.2 SOCIAL AUTH TESTING
   - Mock OAuth provider responses
   - Test registration flow with social accounts
   - Test account linking scenarios
   - Test error handling and fallback flows

3.3 INTEGRATION TESTING
   - End-to-end authentication flows
   - Cross-browser compatibility
   - Mobile responsive testing
   - Security penetration testing

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
======================
- OAuth state parameter validation to prevent CSRF
- Secure storage of OAuth tokens
- Rate limiting on social auth endpoints
- Privacy compliance (GDPR/CCPA considerations)
- Clear user consent for data collection from social providers
- Fallback to traditional login if social auth fails

DEPLOYMENT NOTES
===============
1. Set OAuth environment variables in production:
   - GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID & GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET  
   - FACEBOOK_APP_ID & FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET

2. Frontend integration needed:
   - Add social login buttons to affiliate registration UI
   - Handle OAuth callback redirects
   - Display linked social accounts in user profiles

NOTES
=====
- Current system uses PBKDF2 with 100k iterations - maintain this security level
- Existing JWT/refresh token system is solid - integrate social auth with existing flow
- Rate limiting and account locking already implemented - extend to social auth endpoints
- Comprehensive audit logging already in place - ensure social auth events are logged
